## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

Identify the purpose of this SDD and its intended audience. 

### 1.2 Scope

Provide a description and scope of the software and explain the goals, objectives and benefits of your project.

### 1.3 Overview

Provide an overview of this document and its organization.

### 1.4 Reference Material

Optional. List any documents that were used or would help better explain the choices made in this document.

### 1.5 Definitions and Acronyms

Optional. Provide definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations that might exist to properly interpret the SDD.

## 2 System Overview

Give a general description of the functionality, context and design of your project. Provide any background information if necessary.

This is likely a good spot for a diagram of the design.

## 3 System Architecture

### 3.1 Architectural Design

Determine the structure of the solution and how it generally will be implemented.

### 3.2 Design Rationale

Discuss the rationale for selecting the architecture described in 3.1 including trade offs and issues considered. This is a good spot to say why certain things fell in your scope and not someone else. Adding things such as why you chose a specific pattern or style is also good.

## 4 Tools & Tech Stack

### 4.1 Tools

Describe all tools that are needed and used in this part of the project. May include references to download anything not in the initial startup.

### 4.2 Tech Stack

This can likely be the same as other SDD's but may differ if you are working on something specific and need another langauge or piece of architecture.

## 5 Requirements Matrix

Describe all requirements that this document meets.
Example:

Requirement 1: A system that can pull data from a database.

Requirement2: A system that can transform data into a format usable by -other- system.

## 6 Appendices

Optional. Appendices may be included, either directly or by reference, to provide supporting details that could aid in the understanding of the Software Design Document.
